# BeaconResources

#### Gordon Petry

BeaconResources is a web application that will allow for easy access to verified resources, such as homeless shelters and food banks, by county in New Jersey with appropriate category filtering. This project aims to assist the homeless population in finding the resources they need. I intend on adding a more organized solution to the more popular means of searching for help which currently includes an uncategorized list through Google Maps or Apple Maps if you are outside a major city.
